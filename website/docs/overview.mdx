# env-secrets

`env-secrets` is a Node.js CLI that fetches secrets from a vault (starting with **AWS Secrets Manager**) and injects them into the **environment variables** of a child process you run.

**Highlights**

- Pull JSON secrets and expose each key as `ENV`.
- Run *any* command with injected secrets: `env-secrets aws -s <name> -- <your command>`.
- Works globally (`npm i -g env-secrets`) or with `npx` per project.
- Debug-friendly (`DEBUG=env-secrets,...`).
